Introduction and Operations in numpy.

# What is NumPy
NumPy stands for numeric python which is a python package for the computation and processing of the multidimensional and single dimensional array elements.

Travis Oliphant created NumPy package in 2005 by injecting the features of the ancestor module Numeric into another module Numarray.

It is an extension module of Python which is mostly written in C. It provides various functions which are capable of performing the numeric computations with a high speed.

NumPy provides various powerful data structures, implementing multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. These data structures are used for the optimal computations regarding arrays and matrices.

In this tutorial, we will go through the numeric python library NumPy.
